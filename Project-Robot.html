            <h2> Objective </h2>
            <p> My department, Engineering Physics, hosts a Robot Competition every year where teams of four students build autonomous robots to compete in a custom course with objectives and obstacles changing each year. The Robot Competition is the culmination of ENPH 253, an in-depth course in design and fabrication developed with inspiration from both Stanford's ME210 and MIT's ME2.007. It is both ridiculously intensive and rewarding, giving students a plethora of applicable skills. </p>
            <p> For the first half of the summer, students take a packed academic term consisting of frequent ENPH 253 labs and various other coursework. The second half of the summer is dedicated to the Robot Competition, with students often putting in 12 hour days 6 or 7 days a week in the month leading up to the competition. </p>

            <h3> Competition Course </h3>
            <p> The course, Star-Wars themed, had stuffed ewoks at various locations. Points were awarded for "rescuing" the ewoks by picking them up and returning them to the starting area. </p>
            <p> There were many obstacles, including: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p> A 6" gap </p></li>
                <li> <p> A narrow archway, with an IR beacon indicating when it was safe to pass through </p></li>
                <li> <p> A second gap, this time to an elevated, round platform </p></li>
                <li> <p> A 1" aluminum tube that robots could use to traverse the gap, <a href = "">if they dared</a> </p></li>
                <li> <p> An unmarked suspension bridge </p></li>
            </ul>
<!--             <p> The first platform had a black tape path which could be used for navigation. The tape went up a ramp, where an ewok was situated at the top. The path takes a 90 degree turn, then goes through a 6" wide, 6" deep gap in the course. Robots have to traverse this gap to make it to the second platform. </p>
            <p> The second platform continued the black tape path to an ewok, then a gate with an IR beacon indicating when to pass through. After passing through, the tape path ends at another ewok. </p>
            <p> The third platform began on a raised circular platform separated by another 6" gap from the second; this is the part of the course where most groups had to decide between continuing onwards or returning their saved ewoks to base to maximize points and consistency. There was also a 1" diameter aluminum tube running over the platforms at this location that robots could use to traverse the gap, <a href = "">if they dared.</a> </p>
            <p> The third platform continued onto an unmarked suspension bridge up to the final platform, where a stuffed Chewbacca resided (worth extra points). At the top of the third platform was another aluminum tube which ran back to the starting platform; teams could attach their baskets full of ewoks onto this to return them to the start. </p> -->

            <h2> Design Details </h2>
            <p> As a broad overview, our strategy was: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p> Pick up the first ewok </p></li>
                <li> <p> Dump a bridge across the first gap and move to the second platform </p></li>
                <li> <p> Pick up the second ewok </p></li>
                <li> <p> Traverse the second platform and pick up the third ewok (but keep it in our claw as out basket was too small to hold three) </p></li>
                <li> <p> Dump the ewoks over the wall to the starting platform, securing points </p></li> 
                <li> <p> Ascend the aluminum tube via zipline mechanism </p></li>    
                <li> <p> Pick up the forth ewok </p></li>   
                <li> <p> Traverse the bridge, using the edge of the bridge as a guide (by measuring reflectance) </p></li> 
                <li> <p> Pick up Chewbacca </p></li> 
                <li> <p> Zipline back to the starting area </p></li> 
            </ul>
            <p> This was a very ambitious strategy, but had the added benefit of securing many points early on. </p>

            <h3> Zipline Mechanism </h3>
            <p> The zipline mechanism had two components: the extension, and the hook. </p>
            <p> The extension was actuated by a carriage on a power screw with limit switches on both ends. I personally designed the hook which sat atop, latched onto the aluminum tube, and pulled the robot across. I've separated that into <a href="Project-Robot.html">another post</a>. </p>

            <h3> IR Sensor </h3>
            <p> I was personally in charge of designing our IR sensor PCB. I've separated that into <a href="Project-IR-Detect.html">another post</a>. </p>

            <h3> Software and Controls </h3> 
            <p> I wrote most of the infrastructure that my group built the codebase on. The robot was designed as a Finite State Machine, with many states corresponding to the different tasks necessary to traverse the course. You can view our <a href="https://github.com/jmiles9/revengeOfThe5th">source code here</a>. However, be warned: we were very stressed for time during the weeks leading up to the competition, and it showed in our code style. <b>View the commit messages at your own risk!</b> </p>

            <h3> Wheels </h3>
            <p> We decided on a 2-wheel RWD and passive coasters in front. RWD was chosen over FWD due to the slight advantage in handling, which was useful for the tight maneuvers necessary in the course. We chose a passive coasters as our front "wheels" due to small ridges and gaps present throughout the course; the availabel rigid wheels would often get stuck on these ridges and gaps. Additionally, the coasters were very easy to install and modify. </p>
