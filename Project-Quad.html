            <h2> Objective </h2>
			<p> I've been wanting to get an FPV drone, but nice ones get <a href="https://www.getfpv.com/ready-to-fly-quadcopters/tbs-oblivion-rtf-set-w-tango-radio.html">very expensive</a>. </p>
            <p> On top of that, they come with archaic-looking monitors and controllers which make storing the device a hassle. The nonexistence of consumer options for smartphone-controlled wifi- or bluetooth-enabled drones is appalling. </p>
            <p> So I decided to get some experience by designing an affordable quadcopter for ease of manufacturing and assembly. </p2>
            <img src="images/Quad Full.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">

            <h2> Design Details </h2>
            <p> My end goal is to control the drone by smartphone via wifi through the installation of an ESP-32 microcontroller, and to have it stream live video to the screen. This has several limitations, particularly: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p> Bandwidth is very limited due to the low-power chip. </p></li>
                <li> <p> It can only be used indoors or closeby to a network. </p></li>
            </ul>
            <p> These restrictions mean that the drone can be medium-sized at the largest, and it will only be able to transmit low-resolution, low-fps video. Additionally, I was unable to find a cheap and sufficiently compact camera gimbal; hence the dual-camera design. This has the upside of allowing a multi-view display, bandwidth limiations allowing. </p>

            <p> The body was chosen to be carbon fiber, as is standard for drone frames due to it being stiff, lightweight, easy to manufacture, and very strong. Miscellaneous supports will be 3D printed PLA, and standard steel fasteners will be used. </p>

            <p> I chose to keep the ESCs on the arms. Another option would be a larger base which houses all the electronics, but this would be a heavier design with higher material costs. I've excluded some parts (fasteners, wires) which I'm confident will fit in the drone from the model. </p>

            <p> I had slight reservations over mounting hole placement compromising the strength of the drone frame. However, after a brief stress analysis under expected loads, it became clear that this was not a significant issue. </p>
            <img src="images/Quad-Stress-Anal.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">
            <psmall> Brief stress analysis of the frame under expected loads. </psmall>

            <p> Notably, the stress peaks around 8 MPa, which corresponds to a FoS of 4 under worst conditions (fibres oriented perpendicular to load). More importantly, the stress peaks at the connection point of the arm and body, not at the mounting hole. This is convenient as I can easily increase the fillet radius at this point; the small fillet radius is only for aesthetic purposes. </p>

            <h2> Manufacturing and Assembly </h2>
            <p> The frame and top piece can be cut from any shop. I received a quote from Armattan Productions for just $50 before shipping. The PLA parts are, of course, easily 3D printed. </p>
            <p> Assembly and maintenance is also very easy, designed to use standard fasteners for most of the mounting. The cameras and other electronics are all easily removeable. </p>
            <p> The only exception to the otherwise completely module design is the PLA column supports, which must be epoxied to the frame and top piece. </p>

            <h2> Improvements and Future Models </h2>
            <p> To address the modularity issue from the PLA supports, I will definitely iterate the at least once more before manufacturing it. The easiest solution would be to modify the rear supports to connect to the carbon fiber pieces via fasteners, similar to the front camera mount piece. </p>

            <p> It'll be a very interesting controls problem to stabilize and smoothen the drone's flight. Ideally, I'd like be able to leave the drone uncontrolled for a reasonable amount of time (~30s) without it drifting significantly. Luckily, the on-board ESCs should make this much easier. The addition of a gyroscope and an accelerometer will likely be necessary. </p>

            <p> Installation of the microcontroller, PDB, LiPos and gyro/accelerometer will require an actual electronics enclosure on the body of the drone. I'm interested in designing the equivalent of an IP65 ("dust-tight") rating for this enclosure to extend the lifespan of the electronics; this will require a more tightly toleranced design. </p>

            <p> Unfortunately school is picking up and I have less time now (January). It will likely not be until May that I can begin designing the next iteration. </p>
