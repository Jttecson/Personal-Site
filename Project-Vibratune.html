            <h2> Objective </h2>
            <p> During my upbringing playing musical instruments, I noticed that there's a lack of inexpensive, reliable sound-based digital tuners (often the best are vibration-based). Generally, they're expensive and unreliable in the presence of background noise. Additionally, I've been unable to find a tuner which accurately measures variation in pitch over very small time intervals (such as that during vibrato). </p>

            <p> So I decided to develop an iOS tuning app with two main features: </p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:disk">
              <li> <p> Undisturbed functionality in the presence of non-musical background noise ("white noise") or soft musical background noise </p> </li>
              <li> <p> Accurate recreation of vibrato waveforms at medium tempos (2 Hz) for review during practice </p></li>
            </ul>


            <h2> Design Details </h2>
            <p> For this project I implemented the <a href="http://miracle.otago.ac.nz/tartini/papers/A_Smarter_Way_to_Find_Pitch.pdf">Mcleod Pitch Method</a> as it provides a fast, accurate, and robust method, capable of tracking a musician's (or vocalist's) vibrato. </p>
            <h3> Autocorrelation Function </h3>
            <p> The ACF calculated in the algorithm compares the signal with a delayed version of itself. ACF terms are larger when both the data and its delayed term is large. Analysis of the correlogram (ACF over a range of lag values) helps to determine whether data consists of white noise or specific non-random features, in this case sinusoids. </p>
            <h3> Normalized Square Difference Function </h3>
            <p> The algorithm then calculates the Square Difference Function by, unsurprisingly, squaring the difference of the data with its delayed version. This SDF terms are large when the difference between the data and its delayed term is large, in contrast to the ACF. </p>
            <p> The Normalized Square Difference Terms are calculated last, dividing the SDF terms by the ACF terms. This causes data terms which have large delayed terms with similar magnitude to dominate. </p>
            <p> Qualitatively, the NSDF terms drastically reduce random noise. This enables the crucial of the algorithm: peak detection. </p>
            <h3> Peak-Picking </h3>
            <p> After calculating the NSDF terms, the algorithm attempts to the find fundamental frequency f<sub>0</sub>. This is made more difficult by the existence of many harmonics in naturally produced music. To filter these, a threshold is chosen as a fraction of the highest maximum present in the waveform, and peaks beneath the threshold are discarded. The NSDF creates an "artificial" peak at delay 0 and is ignored. </p>
            <p> The first of the remaining peaks is chosen and its delay is used as the wavelength corresponding to f<sub>0</sub>. It is important to use the first peak rather than, for example, the last peak and dividing by the quantity of peaks. The latter method may appear to provide a more accurate, consistent value due to averaging over more data. It is unreliable, however, due to false positive and missing peaks caused by the interference of f<sub>0</sub> and its harmonics. </p>
            <p> Lastly, the pitch is calculated from f<sub>0</sub> by the simple logarithmic conversion used in the 12-tone scale. </p>

            <h3> Sampling </h3>
            <p> I chose a sample rate 44.1kHz. By the Nyquist Sampling Theorem, this is enough resolution to recreate the highest note on a piano - definitely sufficient for the app. </p>
            <p> To measure vibrato, the sample rate is relatively unimportant; the frequency is much too low for sampling to be an issue. Rather, the rate at which data is processed is relevant. Again by the Nyquist Sampling Theorem, sampled data must be processed at least 4 times a second. To perform this in the app, I sample and call the pitch algorithm in separate threads due to the significant overlap in timing. </p>

            </ul>
            <p> Flow 1.0 was released in August 2018, right at the end of my time at JABT Labs, and multiple updates were released during the months before this - about a release every two weeks at its busiest. Because of this, I was responsible for rapid feature development and bugfixes. </p>
            <p> Upon my arrival to the company, Flow was a very new project and had lackluster test coverage. As such, I created and maintained much of the (back-end) testing infrastructure for the project. </p>
            <h2> Achievements </h2>
            <p> There are a few contributions I made to the project worth special mention: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p> Developing, testing, and redesigning the timeline, layer, and keyframe operations within the timeline. Check out some <a href="https://createwithflow.com/features">Flow features</a>.</p></li>
                <li> <p> Writing a script to automate the release process, reducing release time by 92%. </p></li>
                <li> <p> Creating and maintaining testing infrastructure for app's back-end as well as fixing and maintaining integration with Jenkins CI.  </p></li>
            </ul>
